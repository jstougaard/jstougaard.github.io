Homework 1
==================

A live demo of the site can be found here: http://jstougaard.github.io/homework1/  

Since I had some prior experience with the basics of HTML and CSS, I have used the assignment as a playground for trying out some of the new possibilities of CSS3.  
The result might not be very effective at communicating information. This is however on purpose, since I wanted it to be an explorative experience â€“ both in the context of exploring the collection of animated short and in exploring the potentials of pure CSS.  
  
To get a common theme for the background, I have selected 5 shorts from Disney. I have selected them from different genres so they (to some extent) align with the backgrounds.  
  
All markup is kept in index.html and all styling in main.css.  
  
I have included the thumbnails of the videos directly in the project, because I experienced that The Internet Archive would change the name of their CDN from day to day, making the old URLs unreachable.
